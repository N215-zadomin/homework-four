For this homework assignment, I was to use the prototype from the Travel-Fly website we did last week and make it responsive. The goal of the assignment was to align the items as I wished but to make sure that they did not touch the sides of the browser. The navigation, banner, trip icons, and the booking forms all had to be responsive. It took a lot of testing to ensure they work, and personally I feel like the check in and check out boxes were the hardest to do, I don't believe I did them right. I made sure to test everything on a smaller screen to see if they would work.
